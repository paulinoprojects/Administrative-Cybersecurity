<h2>NIST Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems (SP 800-30)</h2>

## Frame Core 
  - Identifies five cybersecurity functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover) each function can be divided into categories and subcategories.
- <b>Prepare</b>: Essential activities to prepare the organization to manage security and privacy risks.
- <b>Categorize</b>: Categorize the system and information processed, stored, and transmitted based on an impact analysis.
- <b>Select</b>: Select the set of NIST SP 800-53 controls to protect the system based on risk assessment(s).
- <b>Implement</b>: Implement the controls and document how controls are deployed
- <b>Assess</b> : Assess to determine if the controls are in place, operating as intended, and producing the desired results
- <b>Authorize</b> : Senior official makes a risk-based decision to authorize the system (to operate)
- <b>Monitor</b> : Continuously monitor control implementation and risks to the system

## Implementation Tiers
▪ Assesses how closely core functions are integrated with the organization's overall risk management process and each tier is classed as Partial, Risk Informed, Repeatable, and Adaptive

## Framework Profiles
▪ Used to supply statements of current cybersecurity outcomes and target cybersecurity outcomes to identify investments that will be most productive in closing the gap in cybersecurity capabilities shown by comparison of the current and target profiles
