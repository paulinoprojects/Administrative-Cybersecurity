#### Security Control Categories
  - Security Control is a technology or procedure put in place to mitigate vulnerabilities and risk.
  - Security controls should be selected and deployed in a structure manner using an overall framework:
      - <b>AC – Access Control</b>
      - <b>AA – Accountability</b>
      - <b>IR – Incident Response</b>
      - <b>RA – Risk Assessment</b>

## NIST SP 800-53
  - <b>Preventative Control</b>: A control that acts to eliminate or reduce the likelihood that an attack can succeed
  - <b>Detective Control</b>: A control may not prevent or deter access, but it will identify and record any attempted or successful intrusion
  - <b>Corrective Control</b>: A control acts to eliminate or reduce the impact of an intrusion event
  - <b> --> No single security control is invulnerable, so the efficiency of a control is instead measured by how long it delays an attack <-- </b>
  - <b>Physical Control</b>: A type of security control that acts against in-person intrusion attempts
  - <b>Deterrent Control</b>: A type of security control that discourages intrusion attempts
  - <b>Compensating Control</b>: A type of security control that acts as a substitute for a principal control
